Grouping is a fundamental idea in data science - one that helps the data scientist glean overall insights from seemingly disjointed data elements. In this article, we'll take a look at how to group data elements using both the Python Pandas library as well as the distributed computing framework PySpark.

## Grouping in Pandas
In the Python library Pandas, the concept of grouping is often mentioned in the overall context of the term "split-combine-apply".

## Grouping in PySpark
