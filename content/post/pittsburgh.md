Spontaneous road trips are sometimes needed to jolt one out of the rhythm of the regular work week. So one weekend, that’s what some friends and I decided to do: travel to Pittsburgh on a whim. We left Michigan on Friday night after work, ate Potbelly sandwiches in the car, and slept all the way to Pittsburg. Well, only the passengers slept, thankfully. I had gotten a rough itinerary of fun things to do from my friend who studied at Carnegie Mellon and our dear friend Google had also given helpful suggestions, so we were set. As a side bonus, the majority of the movie ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ was filmed in Pittsburgh, so I was excited to see the city firsthand.

Our day started on Saturday. We visited the Strip District, a one-half square mile area filled with street vendors and open-air farmers markets. After stuffing our faces at Pamela’s Diner we waddled around for a bit before setting out to take in the sites of the city. We explored the University of Pittsburgh and its historic looking buildings, napped in the Cathedral of Learning (knowledge transfer by diffusion anyone?), and looked over the city from Mount Washington (pictured above). It had been overcast the whole day and started raining in the evening. Something about rainy days calls for Thai food, so we looked on Yelp, found the restaurant Smiling Banana Leaf and satisfied our cravings. The rest of the night was spent hanging out and playing various board games in our hotel room.

Driving back on Sunday afternoon, I started thinking about the trip. It’s so interesting to see people live out their lives in a different part of the country. It takes you out of your bubble, out of your mundane routine, out into the lives of other people. Perhaps that’s why I enjoy going to new places: life isn’t just about me, even though I so often think it is. Life is about people and relationships. Life is about living in vibrant color with new experiences and discovery. Life is about bridging the gap between who you are and who you want to be. Alright, I’ll stop with the cheesy (genius?) sayings. Go take a spontaneous trip. Peace!
