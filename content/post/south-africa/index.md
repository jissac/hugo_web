Two friends and I flew        
Into a land of beauty -         
Penguins on the beach!           
![brai](brai.jpg)
Barbeque or braai      
Lamb seared to sweet perfection            
Am I in heaven?                  
![shells](shells.jpg)
Seashells by the beach       
Waves crash, mussels grow, splish splash         
Sand gets in my toes        
![safari](safari.jpg)
The best time to think      
Is on a safari ride       
Lions, giraffes, pause           
![benz](benz.jpg)
Benz thinking of you        
Soft breeze, gentle gaze, warm touch           
Let's take a road trip              
![robben](robben.jpg)
I'm free, or am I?       
Do I still hate, I wonder       
Teach me how to fly  
![boat](boat.jpg)
The calm blue, vast sea      
Secrets I've kept, buried deep        
Float along, my ship
![home](home.jpg)
Dash, slide, I jump up     
Falling onto silken sheets     
Sleep, how I've missed you
